#  Anemia Detection via Nail Bed Analysis 

## NOTE: Still this project is in development stage. Nail classifier is not working proper so do not consider its results. 

An AI-powered system that predicts **anemia** from nail bed images using a three-stage deep learning pipeline. Combines **YOLOv8 for nail detection**, **CNN-based polish classification**, and a **custom PyTorch model** for anemia prediction. Easily test via CLI or integrate using a Flask API.


##  Features

-  **Smart Nail Detection** â€“ YOLOv8 model auto-detects and crops nails from hand images.
-  **Polish Classification** â€“ CNN classifier filters out polished nails for clean predictions.
-  **Anemia Prediction** â€“ PyTorch model infers anemia status from nail bed color and texture.
-  **Batch Inference** â€“ CLI support for folder-based image prediction.
-  **API Support** â€“ RESTful Flask API for web & mobile integration.
-  **Visual Feedback** â€“ Displays predictions with confidence and overlays.

# Note: Upload testing images in `test_images` folder while testing with Command Line (Local Testing)

##  Quick Start

###  Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)

###  Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ramprasad4121/anemia-nail-detection
cd anemia-nail-detection

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv anemia_env
source anemia_env/bin/activate  # Windows: anemia_env\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Ensure model files are in the models/ directory.


 Usage

Method 1: Command Line (Local Testing)

```bash
python anemia_pipeline.py
```

â€¢Processes all images in test_images/
â€¢Crops nails and filters out polished ones
â€¢Predicts and displays anemia diagnosis
â€¢Supports: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .tiff, .webp


Method 2: REST API (Flask + Postman)

```bash
python app.py
```
â€¢Server: http://localhost:2000

Endpoints

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/health	Health check
POST	/predict (form-data)	Upload image for analysis
POST	/predict (base64 JSON)	Base64 encoded image


Public API via ngrok

open two terminals
in 1st termianl run
```bash
python app.py
```
in second terminal run
```bash
ngrok http 2000
```

Use the ngrok URL in Postman like:

POST: https://your-ngrok-id.ngrok.io/predict


 Sample Output
